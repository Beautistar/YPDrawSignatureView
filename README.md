# YPDrawSignatureView

I could not find a good signature capturer iOS made in Swift, so I gave it a try. I leaned heavily on the blog entry [Capture a Signature on iOS](https://www.altamiracorp.com/blog/employee-posts/capture-a-signature-on-ios) by Jason Harwig, and [Macheads101](https://www.youtube.com/user/macheads101), he has a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KV1o9hPF5E&list=UU7fIuG6L5EPc9Ijq2_BCmIg) on YouTube.

## Swift 2.0

The class supports Swift 2.0

## Usage

Add a new `UIView` where you want the signature capture field. Set its class to `YPDrawSignatureView`, and connect it to an `@IBOutlet` property in your `UIViewController`. For saving and clearing the signature, add two buttons to your view controller. Hook each button up to an `@IBAction` function.

## Example Project

Check out the example project for more information on how to save signatures and how to clear the signature view.

## Installation

Add YPDrawSignature.swift to your project
